# Introduction

Welcome to the Durandal template project for Visual Studio!

Durandal is a cross-device, cross-platform application framework 
designed to make building Single Page Applications (SPAs) easy to create and maintain. 
It's been used to build apps for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. Now it's your turn...

This sample template sets up a basic navigation-style architecture for you. Below are a few 
"points of interest" for you to investigate along with some brief explanation. For further
information please visit us at http://www.durandaljs.com

## Points of Interest

* The main app code lives under *App*.
* Css, fonts and images can be found in their own folders under *Content*.
* Css and script library bundling has been configured in *App_Start/BundleConfig.cs*.
* The Home view contains the basic page's starter html, links and script references.
