Welcome to the Durandal project!

Durandal is a cross-device, cross-platform application framework designed to make building Single Page Applications (SPAs) easy to create and maintain. It's been used to build apps for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. Now it's your turn...

## Features

* Fully modularize your html and js. ie. Shell.js automatically locates Shell.html, binds and gets composed into the dom. Naturally you can change the conventionsâ€¦
* Leverage promises everywhere as the API uses no callbacks, but has CommonJS promises plumbed throughout
* Experience the first html/js framework where Composition is embraced at the very core. The view/view-model composition features of Durandal are even more powerful than any "native" client framework.
* A simple app model provides you with an app start lifecycle, modal dialogs, message boxes and an event aggregator.
* Build reusable, databindable, skinnable and templatable widgets.
* Leverage optional components for screen and sub-screen activation and de-activation enabling elegant handling of complex screen states.
* Optimize all your HTML and JavaScript into a single file for release.
