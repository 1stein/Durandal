# Durandal

A cross-device, cross-platform application framework written in JavaScript, Durandal is a very small amount of code built on top of three existing and established Javascript libraries: jQuery, Knockout and RequireJS. 

## Features

* Fully modularize your html and js. ie. Shell.js automatically locates Shell.html, binds and gets composed into the dom. Naturally you can change the conventionsâ€¦
* Leverage promises everywhere as the API uses no callbacks, but has CommonJS promises plumbed throughout
* Experience the first html/js framework where Composition is embraced at the very core. The view/view-model composition features of Durandal are even more powerful than any "native" client framework.
* A simple app model provides you with an app start lifecycle, modal dialogs, message boxes and an event aggregator.
* Build reusable, databindable, skinnable and templatable widgets.
* Leverage optional components for screen and sub-screen activation and de-activation enabling elegant handling of complex screen states.
* Optimize all your HTML and JavaScript into a single file for relelase.
