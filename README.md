Welcome to the Durandal project!

Durandal is a cross-device, cross-platform application framework designed to make building Single Page Applications (SPAs) easy to create and maintain. We've used it to build build apps for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android...and now it's your turn...

## Features

* Built on top of the industry leading and proven libraries jQuery, Knockout and RequireJS.
* Enables clean and simple MVC, MVVM and MVP patterned architecures through simple module conventions.
* Promises are embraced everywhere in the API for a robust, consistent  approach to async programming.
* The first html/js framework where *UI Composition* is embraced at the very core and flows outward to everything.
* A simple app model provides you with an app start lifecycle, modal dialogs, message boxes and an event aggregator.
* Build reusable, databindable, skinnable and templatable widgets.
* Leverage optional components for screen activation/deactivation, enabling elegant handling of complex screen states.
* Optimize all your HTML and JavaScript into a single file for release.
* Works with any backend technology.
